    "# 🧬 Translation Efficiency Prediction with Foundation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial where we'll explore how to predict **Translation Efficiency (TE)** from mRNA sequences using **OmniGenBench** and **PlantRNA-FM** (Plant RNA Foundation Model). This guide demonstrates the practical application of plant-specialized genomic deep learning for rice translation efficiency prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📚 **Prerequisite**: If you are new to OmniGenBench, it is highly recommended to first study the **[Fundamental Concepts Tutorial](https://github.com/yangheng95/OmniGenBench/blob/master/examples/00_fundamental_concepts.ipynb)**, which covers general knowledge such as language model concepts, machine learning task classification, and foundation model principles—particularly how PlantRNA-FM works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Biological Challenge: Translation Efficiency in Plants\n",
    "\n",
    "**Translation** is one of the most fundamental processes in molecular biology - it's the mechanism by which cells read mRNA sequences and synthesize proteins. **Translation Efficiency (TE)** in plants quantifies how effectively this process occurs for a given plant mRNA molecule, directly impacting protein production levels in plant cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and predicting TE in plants has profound implications across multiple domains:\n",
    "- **Synthetic Biology & Crop Engineering**: Designing optimized gene circuits for precise protein expression in transgenic plants\n",
    "- **Agricultural Biotechnology**: Engineering crop plants for enhanced nutritional content (e.g., Golden Rice, protein-enriched grains)\n",
    "- **Stress Tolerance**: Understanding how plants regulate translation under stress conditions (drought, heat, salinity)\n",
    "- **Yield Improvement**: Optimizing expression of yield-related genes through codon optimization and UTR engineering\n",
    "- **Plant Defense**: Enhancing production of defense proteins and secondary metabolites\n",
    "\n",
    "However, experimentally measuring TE across thousands of plant mRNA sequences is time-consuming and costly. This is where **PlantRNA-FM** (published in *Nature Machine Intelligence*, 35M parameters), a plant-specialized foundation model, can provide transformative solutions by learning plant-specific translation patterns with remarkable efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Data: Rice Translation Efficiency Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our predictive model, we utilize a carefully curated dataset from *Oryza sativa* (rice), a model organism in plant biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it contains**: mRNA sequences with experimentally determined translation efficiency measurements\n",
    "- **What it labels**: Each sequence is classified as either \"High TE\" (1) or \"Low TE\" (0) based on ribosome profiling data\n",
    "- **Our Goal**: Train a model that can accurately classify any rice mRNA sequence by its translation efficiency potential\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| sequence | label | \n",
    "|---------|-------|\n",
    "| AUGGCCAUUGUAAUUGGCCGACUUGA... | 1 (High TE) | \n",

    "| ...                                | ...  | \n",
    "\n",
    "Find the dataset template in **[Dataset Template](https://github.com/yangheng95/OmniGenBench/blob/master/examples/translation_efficiency_prediction/05_advanced_dataset_creation.ipynb)** and customize it as needed for your experiments.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a trained model, let's use it for its intended purpose: predicting translation efficiency on new mRNA sequences. This process is called **inference**.\n",

    "1. **Load the Model**: We load the best-performing model that was saved during training.\n",
    "2. **Process the Input**: We take new mRNA sequences and apply the same preprocessing steps we used for our training data (truncating/padding and tokenizing).\n",
    "3. **Run Prediction**: We feed the processed sequence to the model and get its predictions. We use `torch.no_grad()` to disable gradient calculations, which makes inference faster and uses less memory.\n",
    "4. **Interpret the Results**: The model's raw output is a probability score. We'll interpret these to make them more understandable, identifying whether sequences have high or low translation efficiency and with what level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate, we'll test our model on a few sample sequences and print out a user-friendly summary of the results. This shows how the model can be used in a real-world application to analyze sequences of interest."
