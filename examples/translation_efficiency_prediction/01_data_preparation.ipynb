    "Welcome to the first part of our tutorial series! This notebook focuses on the most critical first step of any machine learning project: **Data Preparation**. Proper data handling is the foundation of any successful model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Learning Objectives**: Understand genomic data types, machine learning task classification, and master OmniGenBench data processing workflows\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 📚 **Prerequisites**: It is recommended to study the **[Fundamental Concepts Tutorial](https://github.com/yangheng95/OmniGenBench/blob/master/examples/00_fundamental_concepts.ipynb)** to understand the general machine learning task classification and framework concepts.\n",

    "## The World of Genomic Data & Machine Learning Tasks 🧬\n",
    "\n",
    "In genomics, we primarily work with biological sequences, including **DNA** (composed of A, C, G, T) and **RNA** (A, C, G, U). To a computer, these are just strings of characters. Our goal is to translate these strings into a numerical format that a machine learning model can understand and learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on our scientific question, we can frame genomic problems into various machine learning tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task Type | Description | Biological Example |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Sequence Classification** | Assign a single label to an entire sequence | Is this DNA sequence a promoter? (Yes/No) |\n",
    "| **Sequence Regression** | Predict a continuous numerical value for a sequence | How stable is this protein? (e.g., a score from 0.0 to 1.0) |\n",
    "| **Token Classification** | Assign a label to *each nucleotide (token)* in a sequence | Which nucleotides in this gene are part of a binding site? |\n",
    "| **Sequence-to-Sequence** | Transform an input sequence into a different output sequence | What is the secondary structure of this RNA molecule? |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we focus on **Sequence Classification**: we will classify a given mRNA sequence as having either 'High' or 'Low' translation efficiency.\n",

    "## 📋 Understanding OmniGenBench Data Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into data loading, it's crucial to understand how OmniGenBench expects data to be organized. This section explains the standardized data templates and directory structures that make the framework so powerful and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗂️ Standard Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "OmniGenBench follows a conventional directory structure that enables automatic data discovery and loading:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dataset_directory/\n",
    "├── train.jsonl              # Training data (required)\n",
    "├── valid.jsonl              # Validation data (recommended)\n",
    "├── test.jsonl               # Test data (optional)\n",
    "├── config.py                # Metadata file (optional)\n",
    "└── README.md                # Documentation (recommended)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of This Structure:**\n",
    "- 🔄 **Automatic Discovery**: Framework can find and load data without manual path specification\n",
    "- 📊 **Consistent Splits**: Standard train/valid/test division across all datasets  \n",
    "- 🧬 **Metadata Integration**: Additional biological annotations stored separately\n",
    "- 📚 **Documentation**: Self-documenting datasets for reproducible research\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Data File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **JSONL Format (Recommended)**\n",
    "Each line contains a JSON object with the sequence and its annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"sequence\": \"ATCGATCG...\", \"label\": 1, \"id\": \"seq_001\"}\n",
    "{\"sequence\": \"GCTAGCTA...\", \"label\": 0, \"id\": \"seq_002\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **CSV Format (Alternative)**\n",
    "Tabular format with columns for sequence, labels, and metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "id,sequence,label,organism,5utr_length\n",
    "seq_001,ATCGATCG...,1,rice,120\n",
    "seq_002,GCTAGCTA...,0,rice,85\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏷️ Label Format for Translation Efficiency Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For TE prediction, labels represent translation efficiency categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Classification:**\n",
    "- `1`: High translation efficiency\n",
    "- `0`: Low translation efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSONL Format:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"sequence\": \"ATGAAACCC...\", \"label\": 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSV Format:**\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "id,sequence,label\n",
    "te_001,ATGAAACCC...,1\n",
    "te_002,GCTATCGAT...,0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Configuration Files\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **config.py (Optional but Recommended)**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"task_type\": \"sequence_classification\",\n",
    "  \"sequence_type\": \"RNA\",\n",
    "  \"num_labels\": 2,\n",
    "  \"sequence_length\": 500,\n",
    "  \"total_samples\": 15000,\n",
    "  \"description\": \"Translation efficiency prediction dataset\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "The dataset file type can also be such as CSV/TSV, parquet, or other formats, in which case the files would be named `train.csv`, `valid.csv`, and `test.csv`.\n",
    "The `config.py` file is optional but highly recommended. It allows you to define important metadata about your dataset, such as the number of labels, label names, and sequence length. This information helps the framework understand how to process your data correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Metadata Fields:**\n",
    "- **`task_type`**: Defines the ML task (sequence_classification for TE)\n",
    "- **`sequence_type`**: RNA for mRNA sequences\n",
    "- **`num_labels`**: 2 for binary classification (High/Low)\n",
    "- **`label_names`**: Human-readable labels\n",
    "- **`sequence_length`**: Typical mRNA sequence length\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Loading Strategy Options\n",
    "\n",
    "OmniGenBench provides multiple loading strategies based on your data format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Method 1: From Hugging Face Hub (automatic download)\n",
    "dataset = OmniDatasetForSequenceClassification.from_hub(\n",
    "    dataset_name_or_path=\"translation_efficiency_prediction\",\n",
    "    tokenizer=tokenizer\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 2: From local directory (JSONL files)\n",
    "dataset = OmniDatasetForSequenceClassification(\n",
    "    \"./my_te_dataset/\",\n",
    "    tokenizer=tokenizer\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 3: From CSV file\n",
    "dataset = OmniDatasetForSequenceClassification(\n",
    "    \"te_data.csv\",\n",
    "    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n",
    "    sequence_column=\"sequence\",\n",
    "    label_column=\"label\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🏷️ Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent file and column names\n",
    "2. **📊 Balanced Splits**: Ensure train/valid/test splits are representative\n",
    "3. **🔍 Quality Control**: Validate data integrity before training\n",
    "4. **📚 Documentation**: Include README with dataset description and usage\n",
    "5. **🧬 Biological Context**: Preserve important biological metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "With this foundation understanding, let's now proceed to configure our specific dataset parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start data processing, we need to install and import the necessary libraries to ensure our environment is ready for the tasks ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Note**: If you have already installed these packages, you can skip the installation step."
