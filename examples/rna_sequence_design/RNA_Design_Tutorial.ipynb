    "# 🧬 RNA Sequence Design with OmniGenBench\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial where we'll explore how to **design RNA sequences** with specific target structures using **OmniGenBench**. This guide will walk you through a complete computational RNA design project, from understanding the biological principles to implementing advanced genetic algorithms for sequence optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Biological Challenge: What is RNA Sequence Design?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNA sequence design** is the inverse problem of structure prediction: given a desired RNA secondary structure, we need to find sequences that will fold into that structure. This is a fundamental challenge in synthetic biology and biotechnology because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functional RNA Engineering**: Creating ribozymes, riboswitches, and regulatory RNAs with specific functions\n",
    "- **Therapeutic Applications**: Designing siRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, and mRNA vaccines with optimal properties\n",
    "- **Synthetic Biology**: Building RNA-based circuits and molecular machines\n",
    "- **Biotechnology**: Engineering RNA sensors and switches for industrial applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge lies in the complex relationship between sequence and structure - many different sequences can fold into the same structure, but finding the optimal ones requires sophisticated computational approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Problem: Structure-to-Sequence Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional prediction tasks, RNA design is a **generative optimization problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: Target secondary structure in dot-bracket notation (e.g., `(((...)))`)\n",
    "- **Output**: RNA sequences that fold into the target structure with high stability\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Navigate the vast sequence space efficiently to find optimal solutions\n",
    "- **Goal**: Design sequences with desired structural, thermodynamic, and functional properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Challenge:**\n",
