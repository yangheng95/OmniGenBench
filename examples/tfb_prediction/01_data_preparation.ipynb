    "# üß¨ TFB Prediction Tutorial 1/4: From Biological Questions to Data Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first tutorial in our four-part series. This guide focuses on the foundational and most critical step of any computational biology project: **understanding and preparing your data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üìö **Prerequisites**: It is recommended to study the **[Fundamental Concepts Tutorial](../00_fundamental_concepts.ipynb)** to understand the general machine learning task classification and framework concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we write any code, we must first understand the landscape of biological data and how to frame biological questions as machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Language of Life: DNA and RNA\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, genomics is the study of sequences. The primary types are:\n",
    "- **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)**: The blueprint of life, composed of four bases (A, T, C, G). It carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms.\n",
    "- **RNA (Ribonucleic acid)**: Often a messenger, RNA (composed of A, U, C, G) plays a crucial role in translating the instructions from DNA into proteins. It can also have structural and regulatory roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sequences are not random strings, and they contain complex patterns, grammar, and syntax. Our goal is to teach a machine to read and understand this \"language of life.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Framing Biological Questions as ML Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "A biological question must be translated into a well-defined machine learning task. Here are the most common types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task Type | Biological Question | Example |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Sequence Classification** | Does this DNA sequence have a specific property? | Is this sequence a promoter region? (Yes/No) |\n",
    "| **Multi-Label Classification**| What properties does this DNA sequence have? | Which of these 100 transcription factors will bind to this sequence? |\n",
    "| **Sequence Regression** | What is the quantitative value associated with this sequence? | How efficiently will this mRNA be translated into a protein? (Predict a score) |\n",
    "| **Token Classification** | What is the function of *each base* in this sequence? | Identify the start and end of a gene within a long DNA strand. |\n",
    "| **Sequence-to-Sequence** | Can we translate this sequence into another? | Given a DNA coding sequence, predict the resulting protein sequence. |\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    subgraph \"Mapping Problems to Tasks\"\n",
    "        A[\"Biological Question<br/>(e.g., Where do proteins bind?)\"] --> B[\"ML Task<br/>(e.g., Multi-Label Sequence Classification)\"];\n",
    "        B --> C[\"Model Choice<br/>(e.g., OmniModelForMultiLabelSequenceClassification)\"];\n",
    "        C --> D[\"Data Representation<br/>(e.g., DNA sequence as input, multi-hot vector as output)\"];\n",
    "    end\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 3. The OmniGenBench Toolbox: Available Models for Every Task\n",
    "\n",
    "`OmniGenBench` provides a suite of pre-configured models, each designed for a specific task. This saves you from having to build them from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task | OmniGenBench Model | When to Use It |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| Single-Label Sequence Classification | `OmniModelForSequenceClassification` | Predicting one label for the whole sequence. |\n",
    "| **Multi-Label Sequence Classification** | `OmniModelForMultiLabelSequenceClassification` | **(Our focus)** Predicting multiple labels for the whole sequence. |\n",
    "| Sequence Regression | `OmniModelForSequenceRegression` | Predicting a single continuous value for the sequence. |\n",
    "| Token Classification | `OmniModelForTokenClassification` | Predicting a label for each token (base) in the sequence. |\n",
    "| Token Regression | `OmniModelForTokenRegression` | Predicting a continuous value for each token. |\n",
    "| Sequence-to-Sequence | `OmniModelForSeq2Seq` | Generating an output sequence from an input sequence. |\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding this mapping, you can quickly select the right tool for your biological problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Our Task: Why TFB is Multi-Label Sequence Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's apply this to our tutorial's goal: **Transcription Factor Binding (TFB) Prediction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It's a Sequence task**: Our input is a DNA sequence.\n",
    "- **It's a Classification task**: For each transcription factor, we are asking a \"Yes/No\" question: does it bind?\n",
    "- **It's a Multi-Label task**: A single DNA sequence can be a binding site for *multiple* different TFs simultaneously. We aren't just picking one from a list; we are identifying all potential binders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the correct framing is **Multi-Label Sequence Classification**, and the right tool from our toolbox is `OmniModelForMultiLabelSequenceClassification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this clear understanding, we can now proceed to prepare our data specifically for this task.\n",

    "## üìã Understanding OmniGenBench Data Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into data loading, it's crucial to understand how OmniGenBench expects data to be organized. This section explains the standardized data templates and directory structures that make the framework so powerful and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üóÇÔ∏è Standard Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "OmniGenBench follows a conventional directory structure that enables automatic data discovery and loading:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dataset_directory/\n",
    "‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train.jsonl              # Training data (required)\n",
    "‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ valid.jsonl              # Validation data (recommended)\n",
    "‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test.jsonl               # Test data (optional)\n",
    "‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py                # Metadata file (optional)\n",
    "‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # Documentation (recommended)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üóÇÔ∏è Note\n",
    "The dataset file type can also be such as CSV/TSV, parquet, or other formats, in which case the files would be named `train.csv`, `valid.csv`, and `test.csv`.\n",
    "The `config.py` file is optional but highly recommended. It allows you to define important metadata about your dataset, such as the number of labels, label names, and sequence length. This information helps the framework understand how to process your data correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of This Structure:**\n",
    "- üîÑ **Automatic Discovery**: Framework can find and load data without manual path specification\n",
    "- üìä **Consistent Splits**: Standard train/valid/test division across all datasets  \n",
    "- üß¨ **Metadata Integration**: Additional biological annotations stored separately\n",
    "- üìö **Documentation**: Self-documenting datasets for reproducible research\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìÑ Data File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **JSONL Format (Recommended)**\n",
    "Each line contains a JSON object with the sequence and its annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"sequence\": \"ATCGATCG...\", \"label\": [1,0,1,0,1,...], \"id\": \"seq_001\"}\n",
    "{\"sequence\": \"GCTAGCTA...\", \"label\": [0,1,0,1,0,...], \"id\": \"seq_002\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **CSV Format (Alternative)**\n",
    "Tabular format with columns for sequence, labels, and metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "id,sequence,label,chromosome,start,end\n",
    "seq_001,ATCGATCG...,\"1,0,1,0,1\",chr1,1000,1500\n",
    "seq_002,GCTAGCTA...,\"0,1,0,1,0\",chr2,2000,2500\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üè∑Ô∏è Label Format for Multi-Label Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For TFB prediction, labels represent binding status for multiple transcription factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Array Format (JSONL):**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"label\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**String Format (CSV):**\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "\"1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each position corresponds to a specific transcription factor:\n",
    "- Position 0: CTCF (1 = binds, 0 = doesn't bind)\n",
    "- Position 1: p53 (0 = doesn't bind)\n",
    "- Position 2: FOXA1 (1 = binds)\n",
    "- And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **config.py (Optional)**\n",
    "A Python file defining dataset metadata and parameters:\n",

    "#### **Key Metadata Fields:**\n",
    "- **`task_type`**: Defines the ML task (classification, regression, etc.)\n",
    "- **`sequence_type`**: DNA, RNA, or Protein\n",
    "- **`num_labels`**: Number of target labels (919 for DeepSEA)\n",
    "- **`label_names`**: Human-readable names for each label\n",
    "- **`sequence_length`**: Fixed length of input sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Loading Strategy Options\n",
    "\n",
    "OmniGenBench provides multiple loading strategies based on your data format:\n",
