    "# 🧬 Transcription Factor Binding Prediction with Foundation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial where we'll explore how to predict Transcription Factor Binding (TFB) sites on plant DNA sequences using **OmniGenBench** and **PlantRNA-FM** (Plant RNA Foundation Model). This guide demonstrates the practical application of plant-specialized genomic deep learning for regulatory genomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📚 **Prerequisites**: If you're new to OmniGenBench, we strongly recommend starting with the **[Fundamental Concepts Tutorial](https://github.com/yangheng95/OmniGenBench/blob/master/examples/00_fundamental_concepts.ipynb)**. It covers essential topics including language model concepts, machine learning task classification, foundation model principles (particularly PlantRNA-FM), and other foundational knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Biological Challenge: Plant Transcription Factor Binding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transcription Factors (TFs)** are essential proteins that regulate gene expression in plants, controlling processes from development to stress responses. They bind to specific DNA sequences in regulatory regions. Identifying these binding sites is critical for understanding plant gene regulation, which is fundamental to crop improvement, stress tolerance, and developmental biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, experimentally identifying TF binding sites across plant genomes is slow and expensive. This is where **PlantRNA-FM** (published in *Nature Machine Intelligence*, 35M parameters), a plant-specialized foundation model, can make a significant impact by learning plant-specific regulatory patterns efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Data: Plant Regulatory Genomics Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a model for this task, we use a curated dataset of plant regulatory regions, adapted from the **DeepSEA dataset** for plant genomics applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it contains**: 1000-base-pair DNA sequences from plant genomes (Arabidopsis, rice, maize).\n",
    "- **What it labels**: Each sequence is associated with 919 binary labels indicating the presence or absence of various chromatin features, including plant TF binding, DNase I sensitivity, and histone marks specific to plant genomes.\n",
    "- **Our Goal**: Train PlantRNA-FM to predict which of the 919 features are present for any given plant DNA sequence.\n",
