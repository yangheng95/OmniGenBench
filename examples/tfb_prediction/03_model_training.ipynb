    "## \u001f TFB Prediction Tutorial 3/4: Model Training - Teaching the Model to Predict\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third tutorial in our series. So far, we have:\n",
    "1.  Prepared our dataset and dataloaders ([01_data_preparation.ipynb](https://github.com/yangheng95/OmniGenBench/blob/master/examples/tfb_prediction/01_data_preparation.ipynb)).\n",
    "2.  Selected and initialized the correct model architecture ([02_model_initialization.ipynb](https://github.com/yangheng95/OmniGenBench/blob/master/examples/tfb_prediction/02_model_initialization.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have all the ingredients ready. In this tutorial, we will combine them to **train** the model. Training is the process of teaching the model to make accurate predictions by showing it examples from our dataset and adjusting its internal parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover:\n",
    "1.  **The Concept of Supervised Training**: What it means to train a model and what components are required.\n",
    "2.  **Trainers in `OmniGenBench`**: An overview of the different training engines available in the framework.\n",
    "3.  **The Training Process in Action**: A step-by-step guide to configuring and launching the training job.\n",
    "4.  **Evaluation and Results**: How we measure the model's performance and what artifacts are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fine-tuned model saved on your disk, ready for inference."

    "### 1. The Concept of Supervised Training\n",
    "\n",
    "At its heart, **supervised training** is like teaching a student with a textbook and an answer key. We show the model an input (a DNA sequence), let it make a prediction, and then compare its prediction to the correct answer (the labels). The difference between the prediction and the answer is quantified by a **loss function**. The goal is to minimize this loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is iterative and happens in a **training loop**, which consists of four main steps:\n",
    "1.  **Forward Pass**: The input data is passed through the model to get a prediction.\n",
    "2.  **Loss Calculation**: The model's prediction is compared to the ground-truth labels using a loss function (e.g., Binary Cross-Entropy for our task).\n",
    "3.  **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**: The loss is used to calculate the gradient for each of the model's parameters. The gradient tells us how to adjust each parameter to reduce the loss.\n",
    "4.  **Optimizer Step**: An **optimizer** (like AdamW) updates the model's parameters based on the calculated gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage this entire process, we need a few key components:\n",
    "-   A **Model** to be trained.\n",
    "-   **DataLoaders** to supply batches of data for training, validation, and testing.\n",
    "-   A **Loss Function** to measure prediction error.\n",
    "-   An **Optimizer** to update the model's weights.\n",
    "-   An **Evaluation Metric** (e.g., ROC-AUC) to assess performance on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Trainer** is an object that encapsulates this entire training loop, abstracting away the boilerplate code and providing a clean interface to manage training, evaluation, and logging."
