    "1.  **PlantRNA-FM Base Model**: This is a large, pre-trained transformer model specifically trained on plant genomic and transcriptomic data. Its job is to read a plant DNA sequence (as a series of tokens) and convert it into a rich numerical representation (an embedding) that captures plant-specific regulatory patterns, motifs, and chromatin contexts.\n",
    "2.  **The Multi-Label Classification Head**: This is a smaller neural network (usually one or two linear layers) that sits on top of PlantRNA-FM. It takes the plant sequence embedding and transforms it into 919 independent binary predictions for transcription factor binding.\n",
