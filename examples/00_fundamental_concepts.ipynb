    "### 1.1 The Language Model Revolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, **Language Models (LMs)** such as BERT and GPT have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. These models learn intrinsic patterns of language—grammar, context, and even semantics—through pre-training on vast amounts of text data. This enables them to be \"fine-tuned\" for a wide range of specific tasks (e.g., translation, summarization, question answering).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 A New Paradigm in Biology: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The same principles can be applied to biology. The \"language of life\" is written in RNA and DNA sequences using nucleotides (A, C, G, U/T) as \"letters.\" **Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs)**, such as **OmniGenome** (Yang et al., 2025), are large-scale models pre-trained on massive genomic sequence datasets.\n",
