  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "This dataset addresses the fundamental problem of RNA secondary structure prediction using token-level classification. The task involves predicting the base-pairing pattern of RNA sequences using dot-bracket notation, where '(' and ')' represent paired bases (forming helical structures like stems) and '.' represents unpaired bases (forming loops, bulges, or single-stranded regions). Secondary structure prediction is crucial for understanding RNA function, RNA-protein interactions, drug target identification, and designing synthetic RNA molecules. The Archive2 dataset provides a curated collection of RNA structures from diverse RNA families.",

  "notes": "This dataset is part of the RGB (RNA Genomics Benchmark) suite and represents one of three secondary structure prediction benchmarks. The Archive2 dataset is relatively small but contains high-quality, manually curated structures. Models are trained to predict structure from sequence alone, mimicking the thermodynamic folding process. Success on this task demonstrates the model's ability to capture sequence-structure relationships and RNA folding principles encoded in genomic foundation models."
