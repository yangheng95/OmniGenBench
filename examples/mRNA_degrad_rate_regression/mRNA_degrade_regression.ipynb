    "# 🧬 mRNA Degradation Rate Prediction with OmniGenBench\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial where we'll explore how to predict **mRNA degradation rates** from RNA sequences using **OmniGenBench**. This guide will walk you through a complete genomic deep learning project, from understanding the fundamental biological concepts to deploying a trained model for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Biological Challenge: What is mRNA Degradation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**mRNA degradation** is a crucial regulatory mechanism in gene expression that controls the stability and lifespan of mRNA molecules in cells. The rate at which mRNA degrades directly impacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protein production levels**: Stable mRNAs produce more proteins over time\n",
    "- **Gene expression dynamics**: Rapid degradation enables quick response to cellular signals  \n",
    "- **Cellular homeostasis**: Proper mRNA turnover maintains balanced protein levels\n",
    "- **Disease mechanisms**: Dysregulated mRNA stability contributes to various disorders\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and predicting mRNA degradation rates has profound implications across multiple domains:\n",
    "- **Therapeutic Design**: Engineering mRNA-based therapeutics (like COVID-19 vaccines) with optimal stability\n",
    "- **Synthetic Biology**: Designing gene circuits with precise temporal control\n",
    "- **Disease Research**: Understanding how mutations affect mRNA stability in genetic disorders\n",
    "- **Biotechnology**: Optimizing protein production in industrial applications\n",
    "\n",
    "However, experimentally measuring degradation rates across thousands of mRNA sequences is time-consuming and costly. This is where computational methods, particularly deep learning with Genomic Foundation Models, provide transformative solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Data: mRNA Degradation Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our predictive model, we utilize a carefully curated dataset containing mRNA sequences with experimentally determined degradation parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it contains**: mRNA sequences with multiple degradation rate measurements under different conditions\n",
    "- **What it labels**: Each sequence has three continuous values representing degradation rates:\n",
    "  - `reactivity`: General degradation reactivity\n",
    "  - `deg_Mg_pH10`: Degradation under Mg2+ and pH 10 conditions  \n",
    "  - `deg_Mg_50C`: Degradation under Mg2+ and 50°C conditions\n",
    "- **Our Goal**: Train a model that can accurately predict degradation rates for each nucleotide position in mRNA sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| sequence | reactivity | deg_Mg_pH10 | deg_Mg_50C |\n",
    "|---------|------------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| AUGCCAU... | [0.1, 0.2, ...] | [0.15, 0.25, ...] | [0.3, 0.4, ...] |\n",
    "| AUGCUA... | [0.05, 0.1, ...] | [0.2, 0.3, ...] | [0.25, 0.35, ...] |\n",

    "### 3. The Tool: From Language Models to Genomic Foundation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Rise of Language Models\n",
    "In recent years, **Language Models (LMs)** like BERT have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). Trained on vast amounts of text, they learn the underlying patterns of language—grammar, context, and even semantics. This allows them to be \"fine-tuned\" for a wide range of specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A New Paradigm in Genomics: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs)\n",
    "The same principles can be applied to biology. The \"language of life\" is written in RNA and DNA sequences using nucleotides (A, C, G, U/T). **Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs)**, like **OmniGenome** (Yang et al., 2025), are large-scale models pre-trained on massive amounts of genomic sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will follow a standard 4-step fine-tuning pipeline for **token-level regression**, where we predict continuous values for each nucleotide position in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The Workflow: A 4-Step Guide to Fine-Tuning\n",

    "We will follow a standard 4-step fine-tuning pipeline, which is a common practice in machine learning.\n",
