    "# 🧬 RNA Secondary Structure Prediction with OmniGenBench\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial where we'll explore how to predict **RNA secondary structures** from primary sequences using **OmniGenBench**. This guide will walk you through a complete genomic deep learning project, from understanding the fundamental biological concepts to deploying a trained model for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📚 **Prerequisites**: If you're new to OmniGenBench, we strongly recommend starting with the **[Fundamental Concepts Tutorial](https://github.com/yangheng95/OmniGenBench/blob/master/examples/00_fundamental_concepts.ipynb)**. It covers essential topics including language model concepts, machine learning task classification, foundation model principles, and other foundational knowledge.\n",

    "### 1. The Biological Challenge: What is RNA Secondary Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNA secondary structure** refers to the pattern of base pairing within a single RNA molecule, forming loops, stems, and other structural elements that are crucial for RNA function. Understanding these structures is fundamental because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functional Importance**: RNA structure directly determines function in processes like catalysis (ribozymes), regulation (miRNAs), and protein synthesis (rRNA, tRNA)\n",
    "- **Disease Relevance**: Structural mutations can disrupt RNA function, leading to genetic disorders\n",
    "- **Drug Design**: RNA structures serve as targets for therapeutic interventions\n",
    "- **Synthetic Biology**: Designing functional RNA molecules requires precise structural control\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge lies in predicting these complex three-dimensional folding patterns from linear sequence information - a problem that has puzzled scientists for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Data: RNA Secondary Structure Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our predictive model, we utilize the **bpRNA dataset**, a comprehensive collection of RNA sequences with experimentally determined secondary structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it contains**: RNA sequences with annotated base-pairing patterns\n",
    "- **What it labels**: Each nucleotide position is classified based on its structural role:\n",
    "  - `.` (unpaired/loop regions)\n",
    "  - `(` and `)` (base-paired positions forming stems)\n",
    "- **Our Goal**: Train a model that can accurately predict the structural state of each nucleotide position\n",
