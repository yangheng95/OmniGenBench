    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, [01_data_preparation.ipynb](01_data_preparation.ipynb), we defined our biological task—predicting RNA secondary structure—and prepared our data accordingly. We framed it as a **token classification** problem where each nucleotide receives a structural label.\n",
    "\n",
    "This crucial step of defining the task and data format dictates our next decision: **choosing the right model architecture**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📚 **Learning Objectives**: Master model initialization patterns, understand foundation model concepts, and leverage OmniGenBench's intelligent defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Power of Pre-trained Models 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind fine-tuning is to leverage **pre-trained foundation models**. These models have already learned the fundamental \"language\" of genomes from vast amounts of unlabeled sequence data. This pre-training endows them with powerful, general-purpose understanding of genomic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to take this general knowledge and specialize it for our specific problem: RNA secondary structure prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Use Foundation Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Traditional Methods | Foundation Model Approach |\n",
    "|---------|------------|\n",
    "| 🔧 Requires hand-crafted features | 🤖 Automatically learns representations |\n",
    "| 📚 Relies on prior biological knowledge | 🔬 Discovers patterns from data |\n",
    "| 🎯 Limited generalization ability | 🌐 Strong cross-task generalization |\n",
    "| 📊 Needs large amounts of task-specific data | 💡 Can fine-tune with small datasets |\n",

    "Let's visualize the architecture. At its core, our model consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OmniGenome Base Model**: A large, pre-trained transformer that reads RNA sequences (as tokens) and converts them into rich numerical representations (embeddings) that capture sequence patterns and contexts.\n",
