    How to Use This Reference:

    - Browse API documentation by functional category below.
    - Each section contains detailed classes, functions, usage examples, and extension guidelines.
    - Start with Abstract Classes to understand the core interfaces, then explore Auto-Pipelines, CLI Commands, and Online Hubs as needed.

    Main API Categories:

    - **Abstract Classes:**  Core interfaces for datasets, models, metrics, and tokenizers. Use these as base classes for custom extensions.
    - **Auto-Pipelines:**  Automated benchmarking and training workflows, including AutoBench, AutoTrain, and related configuration classes.
    - **CLI Commands:**  Command-line tools for running benchmarks, training, and managing resources.
    - **Online Hubs:**  Access pre-trained models, datasets, and pipelines via hub utilities.
    - **Low-level Modules:**  Detailed and fine-grained modules, for development reference.
